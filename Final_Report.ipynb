    "This project provides an analysis on the NFL and Fantasy Football rankings. The dataset we are using is public information that is kept by the NFL and Fantasy Football sites, including statistics on players and average draft positions by fantasy football league players. For those who are unfamiliar with Fantasy Football a short summary is that it is a game involving a league of players who draft NFL players to be a part of their own team that will compete based on a points system against other people who are in the league on a weekly basis. Many of these leagues involve sums of money, which is why players try their best to do their research and figure out which players will be the best. This includes \"breakout players\" who are players that the majority of fantasy players did not expect to do as well as they did and ended up with a much higher rank than they were drafted on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first findings on the relationship between the average draft position and postseason rankings are being used to determine whether the ADP is a trusted influence when choosing draft picks. From our regression fit, there is an estimated 1 change of Postseason ranking per ADP which is ideally expected but the intercept of the line is 64. There seems to be a linear correlation but the values are off by 64 positions. This indicates that players can use the ADP as a value to be considered but won't give precise information on when a player should be drafted. \n",

    "My second finding looked into the relationship between the postseason ranking and statistics of Wide Receivers. From our correlation matrix, there is a greatest relationship between postseason ranking and "

    "## Hypothesis 1:\n",
    "### Average Draft Position in Fantasy Football is a good indicator of post-season rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the relationship between the ADP and post-season rank over the course of recent history. \n",
    "- Given that players every year have an average draft position due to fantasy football as well as a post-season rank based on their peformance their variability can be aggregated and plotted. \n",
    "- We will set a certain value for correlation before-hand to find if the adp values meet the threshold of correlation to be considered a valued source.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning about the degree of correlation between ADP and the player's post-season rank we will determine whether fantasy football players could trust these values when making picks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis 2: \n",
    "### Points and 10+ Yards received can linearly predict post-season rank for a wide receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the relationship between the different Wide Receiver statistics and their post-season ranks. \n",
    "- By analyzing the factors which indicate good post-season rank, I hope to learn about what statistics can be especially indicative of good performance. \n",
    "- A value greater than 0.5 would indicate there to be sign of correlation between that statistic and post-season rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to all football positions having very different metrics through which their plays are evaluated, we are only focusing on wide receivers in particular. In this way, this sort of hypothesis and analysis is helpful for understanding why certain players end up being more successful through a season and thus ranking higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis 3:\n",
    "### Breakout Wide Receivers will see an improvement in similar statistics from the year prior to their breakout year. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the relationship between the statistics of a breakout player in the season before and during their breakout year. \n",
    "- By defining the breakout player, as someone who had an ADP greater than 150 and ended with an overall rank less than 50 we will be able to determine who fits this description.\n",
    "- After getting the data on these few breakout players we will be able to utilize correlation matrices and regression modelling to determine what statistics impacted their post-season rank the most. \n",
    "\n",
    "By learning about what improvements make the greatest change in wide receiver ranking, players can better determine what part of their game they should improve on most to add more value to themselves. Also fantasy football players will gain a better idea on which players show potential when making their weekly rosters. "

These include factors such as injury that can occur at any point in the season or off-season and vary in severity, the chemistry between the wide receiver and his quarterback as better chemistry would allow for better overall performance, that a breakout player could be in their rookie season and not have any prior data, and the personal factors that might affect the players’ ability in games. These are all subjective factors that cannot be put down as data, thus limiting the accuracy of our analysis and predictions. \n",

    "We only looked back to 2013, as more advanced statistics started to be measured then. These advanced statistics include yards per reception (Y/R), yards before contact with an opponent per reception (YBC/R), the distance the ball traveled in the air per reception (AIR/R), yards after catch per reception (YAC/R),  yards after contact per reception (YACON/R), number of plays that were greater than a certain distance (10+ YDS, 20+ YDS, 30+ YDS, 40+ YDS, 50+ YDS). We believe that these statistics will give us a better understanding of the similar performance on a per reception basis between different breakout players compared to using more basic statistics such as total yards. \n",

Breakout players are something that don’t occur often which means that we won’t find many players that fit both our breakout player criteria and broke out after 2013. This is why we limited our data to only wide receivers, who historically have the most breakout players compared to any other position. By having more breakout players we would have more data to compare between each other and against current players. There are breakout players in other positions and data on them but only a fraction of how many players that breakout in the wide receiver position. "
